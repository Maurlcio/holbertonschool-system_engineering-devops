# Web Infrastructure Diagram Design

The point of this project was to focus on the framework of a website at a conceptual level, working off a simple LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python).

Each task has two files dedicated to it, one for the link to the diagram, and another with an answer sheet meant to elaborate on core concepts posed by the task.
