## What is a server?

A server is a software or hardware device that accepts and responds to requests made over a network. Servers can receive requests for web files and send said files to a device requesting them (AKA, a "client"). Servers are usually stored in isolation within closets or, in the case of a remote storage place, within a data center. Servers can run on an advanced type of OS, often referred to as a server OS, which have extra features and capabilities required within a client-server architecture.

## Why is server scaling an issue?

This server infrastructure is unable to scale, which means it will not be able to handle any amount of traffic that overwhelms the server's capacity. For any website with a decent amount of constant traffic, this poses a massive issue.
